# In this section you specify when a player should be logged.
# Specify certain actions to be logged via "logActions".
# These actions are the same as in the BanItem plugin.
# Example:
# logActions: hold,pickup,attack
# Now all instances where a player tried to do one of these 3 things
# the plugin will log it.
# The '*' can be used to include all actions.
# Excepting actions, via '!' is currently not supported.
#
# The log itself contains player data, like current name and UUID.
# In addition, the item/action they tried to use and a timestamp,
# both formatted and UNIX std, for reference.

enableLogging: false
logActions: '*'


# The "bannable" boolean allows the use of the
# "bannable" tag in the BanItem plugins config file.
# Add the tag and its corresponding boolean and
# all players who trigger the BanItem plugin
# for that specific item will be automatically banned
# and this occurrence is logged.
# Note that if this feature is active you will receive
# error messages from the BanItem plugin that "bannable"
# is not a valid tag. Add ProtocolLib to fix this issue.
#
# Example:
# blacklist:
#  world:
#    monster_egg_0:
#      hold:
#        message: Banned!
#        bannable: true

bannable: false
