# In this section you specify when a player should be logged.
# Specify certain actions to be logged via "logActions".
# These actions are the same as in the BanItem plugin.
# Example:
# logActions: hold,pickup,attack
# Now all instances where a player tried to do one of these 3 things
# the plugin will log it.
# The '*' can be used to include all actions.
# Excepting actions, via '!' is currently not supported.
#
# The log itself contains player data, like current name and UUID.
# In addition, the item/action they tried to use and a timestamp,
# both formatted and UNIX std, for reference.
